# Nanograd

Nanograd(100 lines of code) is even smaller than [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)

## Fun Fact
I didn't mean to make this smaller. I was actually trying to reproduce micrograd in my own way for learning purpose. And it turns out to be exactly 100 lines of code.

100 is sort of a special number. So I decide to keep this project.

## Features
- Type hints (easier to read and understand in some way)
- Only basic operations (+, *)
- 100 lines of code (ignoring the test part)
